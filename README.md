# DOK - A Web-Based Markdown Editor

## Project Overview

DOK is a dynamic, web-based Markdown editor designed for a seamless and efficient note-taking and documentation experience. It provides a clean, intuitive interface with a file explorer for easy navigation and management of your Markdown files, alongside a powerful editor with a live preview panel.

The application is built with a robust Java Spring Boot backend responsible for file operations and Markdown processing, and a lightweight, vanilla JavaScript frontend that offers a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Key Features

*   **File Explorer:** A tree-like file browser to create, delete, move, and organize your files and directories.
*   **Side-by-Side Editing:** A dual-pane view with a Markdown editor on one side and a live-rendered HTML preview on the other.
*   **Live Preview:** As you type in the editor, the preview pane instantly updates to show the rendered HTML.
*   **Auto-Saving:** Your work is automatically saved moments after you stop typing, ensuring you never lose your progress.
*   **Drag-and-Drop:** Intuitively move files and folders by dragging them within the file explorer.
